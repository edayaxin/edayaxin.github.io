        <p style="margin: 50px 0 0;">This project explores different interactive mechanisms between children and a social robot that improves children’s engagement in art making and interests in new artistic skills learning. With an emphasis on nonverbal behaviors of the robot, controlled experiments investigate social robot features such gaze, body movement in the context of children’s art making.

          User Research at STEAM Carnival in Children's Museum of Pittsburgh
        </h3>

        <p>  
        Two activities for children were designed and conducted during the STEAM Carnival at Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh on Nov 22 and 23. The age range for the participating children was three to thirteen. The first one was designing robots with certain functions, such as “Design a robot that creates art with you”, “Design a robot that tells stories for you”, “Design a robot you want to be friends with”. Some observations from this activity are that children from different age ranges respond to the task description, their engagement time for drawing is normally around 1-5 minutes.

        The second activity invited groups of children to interact with the robot, and one of the children was control the robot to have it move around and trigger programmed animations. One observation was that the social dynamics among a group of children changed greatly when they chased around the robot, that they treat the robot as one player in the game and got excited by the unexpected actions from the robot.

      <h3>Pilot Study - Collabroative Drawing</h3>
      <p>
        This study is particularly interested in the expressive social factors on the robot and aim to investigate how it can affect people’s decision making. The social robot Kuri was programmed into two modes: with or without expressive behaviors. It can achieve expressive behaviors with gaze, head movement, body rotation, sound and chest light. In order to have the robot create drawing on the floor, it was set up as in the picture below. The collaboration is through a joystick that is programmed to control movements of the robot. Besides joystick, the robot can be remotely controlled in Linux system, which triggered the robot’s expressive behaviors and autonomous movement.

      <h3>Pilot Study - Single Perspective Drawing Tutorial</h3>
      <p>
      This study is interested in the tutor role for the social robot. Three CMU students were asked to learn a single perspective drawing on a tablet and create drawings with this technique. The robot acted as a tutor to provide tools, give feedbacks and coordinate the process. There are a few findings in terms of the interaction. First, two participants ignored the signals from the robot when they were drawing, and this reveals a challenge to initialize intended interaction at the right time and in an effective way. Also, the time of engagement varies among the participants that one of them finished the task very fast while the other two stayed for longer time. The time factor could be a more uncontrollable factor when involving children in this process. In addition, the participants mentioned that nonverbal behaviors of the robot have conveyed necessary information. For example, the song played by the robot was perceived as ending of the session and the green light was regarded as an affirmative sign for the task.
